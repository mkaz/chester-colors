## Chester Color Scheme

I'm a fan of the Chester color scheme created by [Christian Sutter](https://github.com/csutter).

His two original schemes :

* [Atom Syntax](https://github.com/csutter/chester-atom-syntax)
* [iTerm2 Color](https://github.com/csutter/chester-iterm2-colors)


I created a slightly modified set for iTerm colors, the initial selection colors didn't quite work for me. You can download the modified version from this repo, [][chester-dark.itermcolors]

I've also created a [palette for Mac OS X][mac-palette/readme.md] which you can download and use.
