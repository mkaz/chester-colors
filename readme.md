## Chester Color Scheme

I'm a fan of the Chester color scheme created by [Christian Sutter](https://github.com/csutter).

His two original schemes :

* [Atom Syntax](https://github.com/csutter/chester-atom-syntax)
* [iTerm2 Color](https://github.com/csutter/chester-iterm2-colors)


I created a slightly modified set for iTerm colors, the initial selection colors didn't quite work for me. You can download the modified version from this repo, [chester-dark.itermcolors](chester-dark.itermcolors)

I've also created a [palette for Mac OS X](mac-palette/readme.md) which you can download and use.

Textmate Theme: [Chester.tmTheme](Chester.tmTheme)

Visual Studio Code: [theme-chester](theme-chester/) - copy directory to
`~/.vscode/extensions`

If you just want to see the colors, view the [color scheme samples here](https://rawgit.com/mkaz/chester-colors/master/samples.html).
