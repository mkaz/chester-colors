You can install this theme by installing from Visual Studio Code Marketplace, from within vscode use ⌘+⇧+P (command-shift-p) and then "Install Extenstion", searching for "Chester".

You can also copy the folder the `theme-chester` folder to your vscode config directory, on Mac/Linux it is `~/.vscode/extensions`
