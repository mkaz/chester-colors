# Chester Color Scheme

## Visual Studio Code extension "theme-chester"

You can install this theme by copying the `theme-chester` folder to `~/.vscode/extensions`

The theme is based off the work done by Chris Sutter, specifically his [chester-atom-syntax](https://github.com/csutter/chester-atom-syntax).

Here's a screen shot of it in action:
